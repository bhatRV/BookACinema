# Technical Notes
Below are some details on technical aspects of the project and few learnings.

## Assumptions & Design considerations
1. Default port will be -8080, which can be modified
2. Only minimal validations are provided.
3. Comes with few pre-loaded entries, which can be extended by providing an add API
4. 2 seperate controllers to keep it extendable to provide more operations
5. Discount information is stored in DB to provide extendable options for future.

## Scope for Enhancements
1. Extensive test cases to cover more scenarios can be added
2. Validations can be enhanced to include more on the inputs. Basic validations are provided for now.
3. User Interface can be provided.
4. Various levels of testing can be included
5. More APIs to add and update directory can be included
6. Replace H2 Db, with proper db instance
7. Containerize for better deployment
8. Authontication and Security Checks can be added on top of the APIs to make it more secure


### Testing
Unit tests
TODO: Can be improved to include component,blackbox and controller tests etc.
